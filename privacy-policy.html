  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: April 17, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Tilaseo's TikTok Personal App ("the App") handles user information.</p>
  
  <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
  <p>The App is a personal tool designed to automate video posting to my TikTok account using the TikTok Content Posting API. It is not intended for public use or to collect data from other users.</p>
  
  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. It only interacts with my personal TikTok account via the TikTok API, using an access token to post videos.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
  <p>Any data accessed through the TikTok API (such as my account information or video metadata) is used solely for the purpose of posting videos to my TikTok account and is not stored or shared.</p>
  
  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses the TikTok API, which is subject to TikTok's own <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. No other third-party services are involved.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>I take reasonable measures to protect the access token and other credentials used by the App. However, as this is a personal project, no formal security guarantees are provided.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at [tilaseo@example.com].</p>
